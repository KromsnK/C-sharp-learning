#Things i have learned this month:
-S.O.L.I.D principles:
-- SRP(Single Responsibility Principle) - a class should hold only one responibility so it will be easier to maintain whole code. Example: I made "Human" class and left it with changing stats logic(ChangeMood(),ChangeHealth()) and abstracted ShowInfo() and Word(). Right now it doesnt look like i'm using SRP but i'm still working on month 1 and my code isn't done yet.
-- Open/Closed principle - pretty self expanatory. You should use incapsulation for any data you want to be incapsulated.
-- Liko
