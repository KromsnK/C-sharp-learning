# My progress
## This folder contains my progress in learning C# and software development. It includes OOP concepts, SOLID principles, .NET basics and much more in the future. I will continue to update this folder with new projects and concepts as I learn them. 
## To make it more organized, I splitted it into "Month" folders, and every month has a few projects and a README file that contains explanations and theory about the concepts I learned that month.
## I hope this folder can be helpful for anyone who is learning C# and software development, and I also hope it can serve as a reference for me in the future when I need to review some concepts or projects.
## i Will add everything i learned in the "Final project" folder which will be a big project that will showcase everything i learned so far.
# I will also add some notes and tips that I found useful during my learning journey, and I will try to explain the concepts in a simple and easy-to-understand way.

# Month 1: OOP Concepts
## In the first month, I focused on learning the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. I learned about classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and abstraction. I also learned about the SOLID principles and how to apply them in my code. I created a project "Human simulation" which would run a 1 year simulation of "Human" object that has a health,mood,knowledge system.
# Month 2: .NET Basics
## I will explain this month in the future when i will finish 1'st month.
